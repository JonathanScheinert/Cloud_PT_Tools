With the AzureStealthâ€™s scanning results - blue and red teamers can discover who are the users with the most sensitive and risky permissions.
Potential attackers are hunting for those users and the defensive teams must make sure these privileged users are well secured - have strong, rotated and safety stored credentials, have MFA enabled, being monitored carefully, etc.
